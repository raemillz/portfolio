            I got into programming (Ruby, SQL, JS) during my previous position at WeWork. I was curious about learning a new hard-skill
            that could prove useful regardless of the path in which I decided to take my career. This curiosity led me to the Flatiron
            School's online pre-work. As time passed, I found myself wanting to focus on sales less, and code more. I loved better
            understanding the underlying framework of our tech-centric world and the idea of being part of an industry that is at the corner
            of logic and creativity, so a career switch to web development quickly became an all too tempting choice. After being granted a
            Kode with Klossy scholarship, I decided to dedicate the next several months to learning code full-time.

            I attended SDSU where I was granted a scholarship to play on their division 1 womenâ€™s water polo team and majored in
            International Business with an emphasis in Spanish and Latin America. While balancing sports and my studies, I also began
            and lead the SDSU chapter of the Waves for Development non-profit organization as president and participated in the Student
            Athlete Advisory Committee as the Officer of External Affairs. During these defining years, I truly learned time-management
            and teamwork.
